Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,2016-01-18 16:04:58.544059+00,6,239666,26670,approved,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,4

Are there any commenters who are going to call the supervisor on this obvious distortion? 

I think this email-leaking parent did exactly the right thing. If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in ""confronting her directly"". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was ""a joke"", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar ""earth friendly"" and ""cruelty free""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.

There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating ""earth friendly"" and ""human healthy"" ingredients.

Save Water, Reduce Water Pollution, Improve Water Quality
Since most of the zoo's pipes, plumbing and irrigation systems also date back to the 1950s and '60s, many are outdated, leaking and well past their useful lives. The most expensive utility cost at the 55-acre zoo is water, and leaking pipes, run-off, inadequate filtration systems, and lack of water storage all contribute to wasting water and increasing costs. Replacing the sewer system and separating sewage from storm water will reduce pollution, improve water quality and save costs. Adding modern water filtration and recycling systems to the hippo and penguin pools will save over 11,000,000 gallons of water every year.

Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop.

240018,0,"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.

The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).

Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.

It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.

Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.

Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall.

Elephants in zoos are prone to TB, hepatitis, joint and foot problems, and early deaths, not to mention boredom and depression of constricted movement.  
In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.  They are more apt to flourish and show off their gentle and playful personalities.  Visitors see an elephant more similar to those in the wild.

240410,0,"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-09-29 20:15:31.985710+00,111,,32846,approved,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4

Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects Ÿ?? objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative Ÿ?? were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. 

Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.

It is tax breaks and grants thrown at real estate investors.  It's out of state money buying apartments and upping the rent to cover the costs associated with flipping apartment buildings.

In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-21 22:01:57.465388+00,6,240014,32499,approved,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,4
240552,0,"To my knowledge, the commissioner has yet to endorse Anti-Displacement PDX's 28 measures in the Comprehensive Plan. This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city. 

I am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.

All the best,

From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""

Me:
""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-21 22:07:52.119163+00,6,240552,32499,approved,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4

It's one thing if the density is resulting in more sustainable livable communities, but we are not exactly evaluating these developments and this growth on both sides of the ledger--including in particular metrics for displacement. We aren't requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we're facing. Many people in the grassroots understands that density is a radically transformational force in neighborhoods--and one that is controversial in both legitimate ways and in NIMBYist ways.

240579,0.2,"""What causes gentrification is rich people moving here. ""

Nope. It's the uncontrolled housing market that causes gentrification. As neighborhoods become more desirable, the market allows rich people to compete amongst each other and drive prices up. They are also able to privately capture the value that is added with things like infrastructure improvements, even though those things are publicly funded. But it's possible to control this with things like Community Land Trusts. Rich people are only able to drive up prices because our uncontrolled, private market, that treats housing as just another commodity rather than a human right, allows it. 

Sustainable living for the rich, while everybody else gets pushed to the suburbs, is not Climate Justice.

You are struggling with he fact that the working class folks in Portland do not want to live the New Urbanist dream.  Look at the big study Metro did to gauge housing preferences.

Nonsense.  The NY Times had been writing slobbery articles about Portland, whether for the Travel section, or about progressive urban planning/quality of life, for years before Portlandia came on the air.  

There has always been an influx, but the acceleration began in the early 2000s, which tracked with the nationwide trend of younger people as well as middle-aged urban professionals moving back into the city core in pretty much every major, desirable city in the country.  You don't think the same thing hasn't happened in NYC, LA, SF, etc.?  Portland is not unique in terms of rising rents, gentrification, the city center getting more crowded and competitive, etc.  And it's definitely not unique in the fact that its character is changing - that also happens with every other city.

None of these goals are the primary focus of city government. The main functions of a city are providing potable, affordable water, waste water removal and public safety. After that housing and street repair policy and everything else are on the same level and must compete for attention and funding. Below all of that is ""growing responsible businesses."" Actually that is so far down the list it isn't even on the list.

But San Francisco has had rent control for years, yet this is the same policy people are advocating.  If you don't want to become the next San Francisco, why on earth would you rely on the same policies that turned San Francisco into what it is today?

What San Francisco has in spades is an anti-development zoning code and general mentality, which prevents new housing (including affordable housing) from being built.

Inclusionary zoning combined with easing zoning restrictions (e.g., parking requirements) for certain types of residential construction could go a long way towards increasing affordable housing *and* creating the density/walkability that promotes sustainable living practices, and is the best place to start at this point in Portland's transformation.

""Was the government not created to remain the same as it was made?"" 

Er, no? I suspect I'm missing some context here, but the government has evolved over time and (I think) largely by design. The last amendment to the US constitution was ratified in 1992. Legislative bodies revise laws all the time.  Our nation's founders didn't foresee wiretapping and little Sally having a Bouncing Betty for show-and-tell and so forth, so the government adapts to handle things.

I am writing in regards to your recent article concerning the Northwest Academy. As a student, I would like to point out numerous factual errors in your article. First of all, I respect every studentsŸ?? and parentsŸ?? right to disagree with the decision that was made. However, I would like to point that 1) the student in question, with the hit list, was seen by a professional who deals with troubled adolescents. They stated to the school that he did not pose any threat to himself or other students. The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school. As admittedly inappropriate as it was, it is irresponsible to imply the school ignored a threat to any studentŸ??s safety. 2) The implication that because this is a 20K tuition school it should not provide students with a second chance or hold them under more social scrutiny than any other institution is absurd.",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-27 20:56:53.764276+00,6,,34427,approved,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4

It is expensive because it provides a higher academic education in an arts based environment that is not offered elsewhere, not because we have an inherently better-than-public-school student body. Teenagers are teenagers, and as we do pride ourselves on having students with exceptional and advanced maturity, our job as a school is to encourage that, and TEACH them to have that, not mandate every student come in with it.

241165,0,"A brief history to provide some perspective:
McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The PearlŸ??s trunk.
In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed.
The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums. 
Naito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on PortlandŸ??s growth into a unique and desirable city.

Refuge should be able to rent to whomever it wants to and offer whatever beverages or plants or plant extracts that it wants.  Adults should be able to consume whatever they want to behind closed doors when they consent by free will.  

Alcohol is an intoxicant, and the OLCC treats it like a vice and a commodity.  

Cannabis is an entheogen and a vitamin and food.  The OLCC has literally no jurisdiction to mandate that a simple plant can't be consumed along side alcohol.  Assuming adults don't operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, they harm nothing by enjoying any range of substances.  

Lets all remember when religious institutions gained certificates that allowed them to use alcoholic wine for sacrament during prohibition.  Lets all remember that entheogens were/are the original sacrament.  

Moralism is a slippery slope and dictating what adults should and shouldn't do with their bodies within private dwellings is not American.

First of all, Buford v. Houtz was an easement case dealing with sheep trampling over private land on the way to graze on public land.

Second, the quote above is conditional.  If a land is not left open and unenclosed, or if a government action forbids a particular use, then the land is no longer free.  Multiple acts have been passed since 1890, most importantly the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, that regulate grazing on public lands and requires ranchers to pay a fee for those rights.

Since you don't seem to fully read what you are looking at, I will simplify it. The RX is Central RESIDENTIAL. The ""d"" and ""g"" are overlays zones. The ""g"" is greenway and that gives the public the right to access the pathway as a park with many restrictions, like time of day, type of use and  type of vehicle (no skateboards, rollerblades, motorized vehicles).

Only women can harm their babies. Only women can take responsibility for their health by preventing harm to their fetuses or at least taking caution not to get knocked up while doing damaging behavior to their bodies and anything connected to their body like their fetus.

There is no logical reason why men would need to use condoms or get a vasectomy as you recommended because drinking by the male is not known to impact the baby or health of the sperm significantly, although it is known to have an impact on health of the adult overall and that might impact DNA and sperm quality..

Also the affordable health care act made birth control free including IUDs for all women regardless of poverty so the CDC is already giving it out for free. All women who are poor qualify for Medicaid that covers birth control and anyone making money will have private insurance through the exchanges or their employer that pays for it.

I'm not shocked or horrified. As you point out, we're used to him selling us already. But what interests me with this is that it's going to bite him back.

242259,0,"Thank you for writing this piece and putting out the facts in context.  Much appreciated.  While the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is the current ""thorn in our paw"" over public lands my hope is that folks understand that it is just a small, but painful element of a much larger plan to wrest away our public lands to allow exploitation.  That it is being done with lies about our US Constitution and our Founding Fathers is appalling and should anger all of us.  If the militias and protesters are so anxious to deal with ""tyrants"" and those destroying the promise of America they have only to look at the forces bent on stealing our lands for exploitation and buying our political system.  Thanks again for arguing for lawfulness and reminding citizens that our public lands legacy is on the line.",0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-02-09 17:07:27.983829+00,13,,37145,approved,0,0,0,3,0,0.166666667,0,6
